### What are AI agents?

AI agents are mini-programs that are using AI algorithms to perform intelligent operations. For example, a AI agent can:
- summarize a text [todo: add link to public task]
- browse a company URL to extract the list of customers [todo: add link to public task]
- generate SOAP notes from a medical report [todo: add link to public task]
- search the web to answer a question [todo: add link to public task]
- generate product descriptions from images [todo: add link to public task]
- [add more examples, link]

AI agents can access tools, some of which are built-in, like searching the web, navigating on webpages, or your own custom tools.
By combining agents, you can create [complex workflows](link).

## Demo
