WorkflowAI facilitates the complete lifecycle of building AI agents, encompassing all stages from initial prototyping and development to deployment in production and ongoing continuous improvement, including:

- Playground: Compare models side-by-side, iterate on prompts, and save different versions.
- Versions: List all task versions and archive those that are no longer in use.
- Schemas: Define and manage the input and output structures for your tasks.
- Runs: View all executions of a task and search for specific runs.
- Code: Copy the generated code to seamlessly integrate tasks into your codebase.
- Deployments: Deploy specific versions of a task with ease, allowing for updates to prompts and models without any code changes.
- Monitor: Track usage metrics and monitor the costs associated with task executions.
- Tools: Access tools, like searching the web, navigating on webpages, executing code and running other functions.
