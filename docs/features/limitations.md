## What use-cases are not well supported (yet!)?
Currenytly, WorkflowAI agents are not able to:
- generate images, but they can understand images as inputs
- listen and participate in real-time audio conversations, but they can understand audio files as inputs
- TODO: your own custom tools (subscribe to this discussion on GH https://github.com/WorkflowAI/WorkflowAI/discussions/categories/ideas)

WorkflowAI does not currently support the following features:
- fine-tuning and distillation, but you can export the outputs of an agent from WorkflowAI and use them in your own fine-tuning pipeline
- RAG is not directly supported, but [WorkflowAI can be integrated with your own RAG pipeline](). 

{% hint style="info" %}
We expect that all these uses will be supported in the future (by end of 2025).
