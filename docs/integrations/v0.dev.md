# v0.dev

Integrate WorkflowAI with v0.dev to enable AI agents in your app.

## Quick guide
{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Create an agent
Create an agent in WorkflowAI, like you would normally do.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Go to "Code" section
Select "Typescript" in the "Language", and copy the code.
{% hint style="warning" %}
Instruct v0.dev to use a Next.js serverless function to expose the WorkflowAI agent as a API route. Because integration WorkflowAI SDK on the front-end will be a security risk, you don't want your API key to be exposed to the client.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Get your WorkflowAI API key
From the "Code" section, click on "Manage Secret keys", and follow the process to create a new secret key. Make sure to copy the API key, which will be displayed only once.
{% endstep %}

### Setup API key as a environment variable
{% step %}
### Setup API key as a environment variable
Set up `WORKFLOWAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in your v0.dev project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use exactly `WORKFLOWAI_API_KEY` as the environment variable name. If you need to use a different variable name, use:
```typescript
const workflowAI = new WorkflowAI({
    key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
})
```
{% endhint %}

You can setup the environment variable as:
- [specific for the Vercel project](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/managing-environment-variables)
- [shared for all Vercel projects](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/shared-environment-variables)
