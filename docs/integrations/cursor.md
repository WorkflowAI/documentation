# CursorAI Integration

{% hint style="info" %}
CursorAI integration is currently only available for Python.
{% endhint %}

For developers using Python, we've designed a CursorAI integration that allows you to create AI agents in CursorAI, and deploy them to WorkflowAI.

Goals of the integration:
- give CursorAI the flexibilty to create or update a AI agent directly in code,
- but keep the power of WorkflowAI playground to compare models side-by-side,
- use any models available on WorkflowAI,
- and integrated with WorkflowAI observability and evaluation platform.

We've designed this integration to give you the best of both worlds between code and WorkflowAI web-app:
- on one hand, you can use code to define any AI agent directly,
- but on the other hand, you can use the WorkflowAI web-app for features that are more suited for a dedicated UI (like model comparison, observability, evaluations, etc).

## Demo

## Setup

## Create AI Agent

## Run Agent

## Edit
### Schemas via code

### Schemas via the playground
.. you need to edit the schemas in the code as well.

## Improve

## Advanced Workflows

CursorAI agents allows you to build workflows easily. Workflows are multiple agents working together to achieve a task.
