# CursorAI Integration

For developers using Python, we've designed a CursorAI integration that allows you to create AI agents in CursorAI, and deploy them to WorkflowAI.

Goals of the integration:
- gives you the flexibilty to setup the AI agent schema in code,
- but keep the power of WorkflowAI playground,
- use any models available on WorkflowAI,
- and integrated with WorkflowAI observability platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
CursorAI integration is currently only available for Python.

## Demo

## Setup

## Create AI Agent

## Run Agent

## Edit
### Schemas via code

### Schemas via the playground
.. you need to edit the schemas in the code as well.

## Improve

## Advanced Workflows

CursorAI agents allows you to build workflows easily. Workflows are multiple agents working together to achieve a task.
