# For product managers

AI features can help you bring intelligence to your product, using the same AI models powering ChatGPT.
WorkflowAI is designed to empower product managers to build and optimize AI features, **without writing code**. 

> I’ve always had great ideas for AI features, but engineering resources were always the bottleneck. Now, with WorkflowAI, I’ve been able to build and improve AI features myself—no coding, no waiting.
> I can quickly go to market, gather customer feedback, and iterate fast.
