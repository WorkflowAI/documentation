# For developers

> “Being provider-agnostic used to mean maintaining multiple complex integrations. With WorkflowAI, we can seamlessly switch between LLM providers without any extra integration effort or overhead—saving us engineering time and headaches.”
> Aymeric Beaumet. CTO at InterfaceAI.

## Reasons why developers like WorkflowAI:
- structured outputs.
- open-source, deploy anywhere.
