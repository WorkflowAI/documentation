## PII Extraction

PII extraction is the process of identifying and extracting specific entities from a text.

```python
class PIIType(str, Enum):
    """Categories of Personal Identifiable Information."""
    NAME = "NAME"  # Full names, first names, last names
    EMAIL = "EMAIL"  # Email addresses
    PHONE = "PHONE"  # Phone numbers, fax numbers
    ADDRESS = "ADDRESS"  # Physical addresses, postal codes
    SSN = "SSN"  # Social Security Numbers, National IDs
    DOB = "DOB"  # Date of birth, age
    FINANCIAL = "FINANCIAL"  # Credit card numbers, bank accounts
    LICENSE = "LICENSE"  # Driver's license, professional licenses
    URL = "URL"  # Personal URLs, social media profiles
    OTHER = "OTHER"  # Other types of PII not covered above


class PIIExtraction(BaseModel):
    """Represents an extracted piece of PII with its type."""
    text: str = Field(description="The extracted PII text")
    type: PIIType = Field(description="The category of PII")
    start_index: int = Field(description="Starting position in the original text")
    end_index: int = Field(description="Ending position in the original text")


class PIIInput(BaseModel):
    """Input model for PII extraction."""
    text: str = Field(
        description="The text to analyze for PII",
        examples=[
            "Hi, I'm John Doe. You can reach me at john.doe@email.com or call 555-0123. "
            "My SSN is 123-45-6789 and I live at 123 Main St, Springfield, IL 62701.",

        examples=[
            "Hi, I'm [REDACTED]. You can reach me at [REDACTED] or call [REDACTED]. "
            "My SSN is [REDACTED] and I live at [REDACTED].",
