# Get started

{% hint style="info" %}
For engineers.
{% endhint %}

WorkflowAI Python SDK is a library that allows you to programmatically create and run agents in Python, while being able to use the full power of the WorkflowAI platform.

## Install the SDK

{% hint style="info" %}
`workflowai` requires Python >= 3.9.
{% endhint %}

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/workflowai.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/workflowai/)

```sh
pip install workflowai
```

## API Key

Get your API key from your [WorkflowAI Cloud dashboard](https://workflowai.com/organization/settings/api-keys) or from your self-hosted WorkflowAI dashboard.

Set the `WORKFLOWAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Initialize the SDK

```python
import os
import workflowai

workflowai.init(
    api_key=os.environ.get("WORKFLOWAI_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
    url="https://run.workflowai.com",  # This is the default and can be omitted
)
```

{% hint style="success" %}
`run.workflowai.com` is our [globally distributed, highly available endpoint](/docs/cloud/reliability.md)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also set the `WORKFLOWAI_API_URL` environment variable to point to your self-hosted WorkflowAI.
{% endhint %}

## Write your first agent

An agent is in essence an async function with the added constraints that:

- it has a single argument that is a Pydantic model, which is the input to the agent
- it has a single return value that is a Pydantic model, which is the output of the agent
- it is decorated with the `@workflowai.agent()` decorator

{% hint style="info" %}
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is a very popular and powerful library for data validation and parsing.
{% endhint %}

The following agent, given a city, returns the country, capital, and a fun fact about the city.

```python
import workflowai
from pydantic import BaseModel
from workflowai import Model

class CityInput(BaseModel):
    city: str

class CapitalOutput(BaseModel):
    country: str
    capital: str 
    fun_fact: str

@workflowai.agent()
async def get_capital_info(city_input: CityInput) -> CapitalOutput:
    ...
```
{% tabs %}

{% tab title="OpenAI" %}
```python
output = await get_capital_info.run(
    CityInput(city="New York"), 
    model=Model.GPT_4_LATEST
)
print(output)

# {
#   "country": "United States",
#   "capital": "Washington, D.C.",
#   "fun_fact": "New York City is known as 'The Big Apple' and is famous for its cultural diversity and iconic landmarks like Times Square and Central Park."
# }
# ==================================================
# Cost: $ 0.00091
# Latency: 1.65s
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Anthropic" %}
```python
output = await get_capital_info.run(
    CityInput(city="New York"),
    model=Model.CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET_LATEST
)
print(output)

# Output:
# ==================================================
# {
#   "country": "United States",
#   "capital": "Washington, D.C.",
#   "fun_fact": "New York City's Federal Reserve Bank has the largest gold storage in the world, containing approximately 7,000 tons of gold bullion stored 80 feet below street level."
# }
# ==================================================
# Cost: $ 0.001755
# Latency: 2.43s
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gemini" %}
```python
output = await get_capital_info.run(
    CityInput(city="New York"),
    model=Model.GEMINI_2_0_FLASH_LATEST
)
print(output)

# Output:
# ==================================================
# {
#   "country": "United States of America",
#   "capital": "Washington, D.C.",
#   "fun_fact": "New York City is home to over 8 million people and over 800 languages are spoken in New York City, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world."
# }
# ==================================================
# Cost: $ 0.00005
# Latency: 1.26s
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="OpenAI (stream)" %}

```python
# use `.stream()` to stream the output
async for chunk in get_capital_info.stream(
    CityInput(city="New York"),
    model=Model.GPT_4O_MINI_LATEST
):
    print(chunk)

# {
#   "country": "United"
# }
# {
#   "country": "United States"
# }
# {
#   "country": "United States"
#   "capital": "Washington"
# }
# streaming continues...
# ...
```
{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You have created your first agent! Congratulations.
{% endhint %}

Agents created by the SDK are also available in the [Playground](https://workflowai.com/docs/agents/get-capital-info/1).

Runs are automatically logged as well from the [Runs](https://workflowai.com/docs/agents/get-capital-info/1/runs?page=0) section.
