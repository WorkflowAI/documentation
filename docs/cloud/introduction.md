# Introduction

WorkflowAI Cloud is a fully managed version of WorkflowAI, maintained by the WorkflowAI team.

## When to use WorkflowAI Cloud?

We recommend using WorkflowAI Cloud unless you have strict requirements on data-retention, data-residency, or compliance.

For example, WorkflowAI Cloud is hosted only in the US at the moment, so if you want to have your data hosted in the EU, you should use WorkflowAI as a [self-hosted solution](https://github.com/workflowai/workflowai).

## Benefits of WorkflowAI Cloud

The benefits of using WorkflowAI Cloud versus our own deployment are:

- ✅ Fully managed: we take care of the infrastructure, so you can focus on building your AI agents.
- ✅ Always up-to-date: we ensure that you're always using the latest stable version of WorkflowAI.
- ✅ Cheaper: we offer a price-match guarantee, meaning that you're not charged more than the price per token of the model you're using. Learn more about the [price-match guarantee](/docs/cloud/pricing.md). Effectively cheaper than self-hosting.
- ✅ Reliability: we ensure that your AI agents are [always available](/docs/cloud/reliability.md)
- ✅ Compliance: [SOC 2 Type 2 certification](/docs/cloud/compliance.md).
