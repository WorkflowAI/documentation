Once you have a agent working on a first, you need to test it with more inputs. Since LLMs are not deterministic, the fact that it works on a first input doesn't mean it will work on the next one. 

- Use synthetic data generation
- Deploy the AI agent into your backend, start collecting production data.

## Synthetic data generation
[Generate Input] from playground

## Deploy
> This step needs to be implementing by the development team.

Strategies:
- shadow deploy
- subset of users, for example employees, or beta users
