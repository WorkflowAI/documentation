# Introduction

Welcome to the AI Agents Playbook! Based on our experience with customers building AI agents and deploying them to production, WorkflowAI has developed a step-by-step methodology.

This playbook was designed for both product and engineering teams.

## Why should you read this playbook?

> "I expect that we will see AI agents that can accomplish a wide range of knowledge work tasks in the next few years." â€” [_Sam Altman_](https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections)

AI agents are the next big thing. They will be able to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple ones like summarizing a text, to complex ones like planning a trip. Agents will change the way we work by automating repetitive tasks, and the way we interact with products by bringing intelligence everywhere.

### With this playbook, you will learn:
- What are AI agents and what they can do.
- How to build your first AI agent.
- How to test your AI agent.
- How to evaluate your AI agent.
- How to improve your AI agent.
- Best practices for building AI agents.

Developing great AI agents is a process of continous improvement, setting up evaluations, and collaboration between product and developments teams.
