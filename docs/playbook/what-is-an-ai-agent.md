## What is an AI agent?
> for product and engineering teams

AI agents are mini-programs that are using AI algorithms (LLMs) to perform intelligent operations. For example, a AI agent can:
- summarize a text [todo: add link to public task]
- browse a company URL to extract the list of customers [todo: add link to public task]
- generate SOAP notes from a medical report [todo: add link to public task]
- search the web to answer a question [todo: add link to public task]
- generate product descriptions from images [todo: add link to public task]
- [add more examples, link]

AI agents can access tools, some of which are built-in, like searching the web, navigating on webpages, or your own custom tools.

When you use our feature that generates a list of AI agents from a company URL, under the hood, we're using 2 agents:
